Dust explosions pose a great hazard for Solution A's Solvay plant, as a result of the copious amount of limestone particulates stored and transported to and within the plant.

\subsection{Dow's FE\&I}

The Dow’s Fire and Explosion Index is a universal method used to rank the relative fire and explosion risk associated with a chemical process. Process data and material characteristics are used to analyse the hazards of each process unit, whereby penalties and credit factors are determined. Table XX shows the F\&EI for each process unit in the main corresponding process flow diagram and the degree of the hazard according to the index range respectively.

\subsection{Summary of Process Hazards}
\vspace{-10pt}
Using the Risk Matrix and Likelihood Table in Appendix \ref{risk_matrix} and \ref{likelihood} respectively, a summary of the plant-wide risk assessment was carried out in order to pinpoint major risks within the plant. Table \ref{hazard_table} displays the risk, which is a product of the likelihood and the severity.
